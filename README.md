# Angular 2 - Super Simple Master/Detail Demo app
[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-badge-url]

This project is a beginner level getting started demo of a Master/Detail single page "app" that makes API calls to the Star Wars API (SWAPI) to fetch json data for the list of Vehicles, then it will load any Vehicle detail view each time you click on a Vehicle in the list view.

This app is based on the Angular Quick Start guide.
